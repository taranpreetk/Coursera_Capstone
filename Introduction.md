Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

## 1) Introduction/Business Problem
Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.

**The idea of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to chose the right location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same regions.This analysis will basically help the people who are trying to start a new restaurant and earn good money.
In this module we will be using Foursquare API to get the location and try to find out the best place for the opening a new restuarant and the find out the type of people present in that locality and their income.
There are these points that are needed to be kept in mind:**  
1.Popular Locations  
2.Income of people   
3.Population   
4.Restaurants already present in the locality  

## 2) Downloading and Preparing Data
Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.

**To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with Toronto's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.
i.e. we need data about the following items:**  
1.Population  
2.Average income of the people living in particular locality   
3.Location data of the existing restaurant from Foursquare API   
4.Popular locations in Toronto from Foursquare API
